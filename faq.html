<div class="cd-faq__content">
<div class="text-component">
<p>Yes! We always welcome reader tips and queries. Send us links to articles, social media posts, or images using our contact form. If you have screenshots or other relevant attachments, use the “Add File” button on the contact form. Include as much information as possible, including when and where you found the item you hope to see fact-checked. Due to the volume of correspondence we receive every day, we regret that we may not be able to respond to your request personally.</p>

 <a class="cd-faq__trigger" href="#0"><span>Does CWC Debunkers accept guest posts?</span></a>
 <div class="cd-faq__content">
 <div class="text-component">
 <p>The notion of inviting guest writers and experts to research for CWC Debunkers on special topics outside our regular writers’ beats is intriguing; however, we have to be extremely careful to protect the trust we have built with our readers. Properly verifying the credibility of myriad guest writers and their sources requires time and resources we just don’t have.</p>

  <a class="cd-faq__trigger" href="#0"><span>What is CWC Debunkers corrections policy?</span></a>
  <div class="cd-faq__content">
  <div class="text-component">
  <p>Our policy is to promptly correct errors of fact and to clarify any potentially confusing or ambiguous statements in our articles and fact checks. Readers can submit potential corrections through our Contact Form.
  Whenever we change the rating of a fact check (for any reason), correct or modify a substantive supporting fact (even if it does not affect the item’s overall rating), or add substantial new information to an existing article, those changes are noted and explained in an Update box at the foot of the article.
  Corrections of typographical errors, misspellings, or other minor revisions not deemed substantive by our editors are not noted.</p>

   <a class="cd-faq__trigger" href="#0"><span>What is CWC Debunkers fact-checking process?</span></a>
   <div class="cd-faq__content">
   <div class="text-component">
   <p>Since the material we fact-check can range from everything to analyzing whether an image has been digitally manipulated to explicating the text of a Congressional bill, we can’t describe any single method that applies to all our fact-checking efforts.
   In general, each entry is assigned to one of the members of our editorial staff who undertakes the preliminary research and writes the first draft of the fact check.</p>
   <p>Our research generally begins with (whenever possible) attempting to contact the source of the claim for elaboration and supporting information. We also attempt to contact individuals and organizations who would be knowledgeable about, or have relevant expertise in, the subject at hand, as well as searching out printed information (news articles, scientific and medical journal articles, books, interview transcripts, statistical sources) with bearing on the topic.</p>

  <div class="cd-faq__content">
  <div class="text-component">
  <p>No. Using our material without our permission is copyright infringement, even if your site is noncommercial, and even if you give us credit.</p>
  <p>Our writers and editors work hard to keep our information accurate and current, and when other people reprint our material we no longer have any ability to update it when new information becomes available. Reprinting our material without permission also deprives us of the advertising revenues we need to continue operating this site as a free resource.</p>
  <p>You are welcome to link to any of our articles from your site, but you may not reproduce the content of our pages on your own site, nor may you distribute the text of our articles via email forwards or mailing lists, or by posting them to message boards or blogs. (All of these actions constitute copyright infringement.)</p>

  <div class="cd-faq__content">
  <div class="text-component">
  <p>Comment sections can be where civil people go to share thoughtful opinions in a respectful manner. They can also be, and often are, places where anonymous trolls look to give you a digital wedgie and insult your mother for a good time. Instead of investing in hosting and moderating comments, we prefer to focus our efforts on what we do best: fact-checking.</p>
  <p>That said, we enjoy hearing from our readers. You are welcome to comment on our stories on social media or in our Facebook group, where you can also engage directly with other CWC Debunkers readers.</p>

            <p class="text-justify">At CWC Debunkers, we follow a process when we select, research, write, edit and, if necessary, correct our articles.</i> Our topics vary slightly depending on the election cycle.

In all years, we closely monitor the factual accuracy of what is said by the president and top administration officials, as well as congressional and party leaders. However, we primarily focus on presidential candidates in presidential election years, and on the top Senate races in midterm elections. In off-election years, our primary focus is on the action in Congress.</p>
